## How To (Server Admins)
Leaves use the same paperclip jar system that Paper uses.

You can download the latest build (1.20.x) of Leaves by going [here](https://github.com/LeavesMC/Leaves/releases/latest)

You can also [build it yourself](https://github.com/LeavesMC/Leaves#building).

You can visit our [documentation](https://docs.leavesmc.org/leaves/guides/getting-started) for more information.

## How To (Plugin developers)
Leaves-API:
```kotlin
maven {
    name = 'leavesmc-repo'
    url = 'https://repo.leavesmc.org/snapshots/'
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly("org.leavesmc.leaves:leaves-api:1.20.6-R0.1-SNAPSHOT")
}
 ```

In order to use Leaves as a dependency you must [build it yourself](https://github.com/LeavesMC/Leaves#building).
Each time you want to update your dependency, you must re-build Leaves.

Leaves-Server:
```kotlin
dependencies {
    compileOnly("org.leavesmc.leaves:leaves:1.20.6-R0.1-SNAPSHOT")
}
 ```

## Building

You need JDK 21 and good Internet conditions

Clone this repo, run `./gradlew applyPatches`, then run `./gradlew createMojmapLeavesclipJar` in your terminal.  

You can find the jars in the `build/libs` directory.
